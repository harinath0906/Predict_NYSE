# Predict NYSE Next Day closing price
In this project, I will attempt to predict next day close prices for a subset of New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) stocks. We investigated the predictive ability of linear regression, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) model. The objective of our research was to determine a model that generalises across the entire NYSE as determined by the sectors to which each stock belongs. Through the processes of feature engineering and hyperparameter optimisation we found that the LSTM model exhibited the strongest performance with an average mean squared error (MSE) of 0.692 over a one year testing period in 2016.


## Dataset
The dataset used here is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/nyse)

## Below are some techniques covered and demonstrated in the Jupyter Notebook
* Data preprocessing
* Linear Regression
* XGBoost
* LSTM Neural Network
* Tensorflow
* Feature Engineering - Simple moving average, Exponential moving average, Triple exponential moving average, Moving Average Convergence Divergence, Relative strength index, Bollinger bands, Williamsâ€™ %R, Log-Returns
* Visualisation using matplotlib, seaborn
* Hyperparameter Optimization

## Results
The report [here](https://github.com/harinath0906/Predict_NYSE/blob/main/Project_report.pdf) contains the extensive details of all modules used with their background, all experiment results, related work and the details of the neural network.

## Future Work
We also see a potential for future work by optimizing and expanding feature space by leveraging other python finance packages. We also see merits in evaluating other variants of LSTM such as gated recurrent units (GRU). We can also supplement our dataset with candlestick charts and then use a convolutional NN (CNN) in combination with LSTM, as this would help in identifying additional features not available in technical indicators.
